Just wanted to give a quick update on the project and what lies ahead. I am currently going through tutorial hell and trying to absorb every single thing there is to know about the Godot Engine and how to use it. Someone who has only had Unity and Unreal experience in the past I must say that the way of working on Godot is significantly different.

The coding, designing and platforming all happens within the same application, which has it's advantages (I do not deny) but also comes with several hiccups along the way. I am also noticing quite a lot of changes from Godot 3.5 (on which largely most of the tutorials and helps are based on) but this was something that I was expecting when making the move to 4.0. Beyond that I must say that the community working on the engine and actively developing games on it is insane. For any hurdles there's always 10 different people to help out on forums and YouTube comment sections. I believe in the coming years Godot will become a market leader similar to how Blender is today in the 3D industry (a real viable option against the corporate giants... cough Maya cough).

Last but not the least, I love the freedom of working on this engine and the constant knowledge of the fact that some douchey CEO cannot come in and alter the royalty structure to screw with it's users.

In the upcoming days, I plan solely on polishing my Godot skills and begin the world-building needed for the game. This will also include some initial artwork I presume. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming weeks.
