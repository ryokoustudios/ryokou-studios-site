First and foremost let me introduce myself. Hi, I am deadsoftie. Currently, a software dev working out of Bangalore, India. Before becoming a developer I was a 3D artist in college and before that, I was a (believe it or not) rookie DJ in the last two years of high school. The point I am trying to make is that I have changed my focus and interests over the years but one thing that hasn't changed is the burning want to make games. I bought this domain an entire year back and still haven't made an inkling worth of effort to work on it, instead, I have been meandering through life aimlessly without any goals or interests for the past year. Let me tell you. It makes life miserable.

Therefore, starting as of today (January 1st, 2024), I have set a personal deadline to finish work on my first-ever indie game project before the end of this year and have it launched. The rest can be sorted out later but this is the essence of it. If I fail to do so, I shall forget about this whole idea of making it in the gaming industry and go on ahead with my life and none the wiser.

So why am I blogging all of this online? Well first off, I want a complete record of this journey for my personal benchmarking. Secondly, to gain traction if this thing actually lifts off, if not, it'll make a really good Reddit post.

That's pretty much the gist of the announcement. I will be posting more about the planning and commencement of the development of the project in the coming days. But as of today, the first project of Ryokou Studios is now in development.
